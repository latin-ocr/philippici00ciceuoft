27. excussis tuis vocibus: ⁴‘ ignoring your plens.”

29. tabula: “ schedule,'' “ inventory,⁷’ of the intended sale. esse:
exclzunatory infinitivo.

31. partem Miseni: cp. Sisaponem. xix. 25, and the notes there.
nihil: for ull the residue was confisa-utcd property for which the
soi-disant owncr had not yet paid.

32. auetiznaretur: subjunctive in clause dependent on the sub-
junctive dependent clause qnod . . . posset, cte.

35. sordidata: “shabbilycladfl quiequam . . . reliqui: “any-
thing left.” 'l'he genitive is partitive, depending on quiequam.

37. L. Rubrii: above §t 40, 41. Nothing is known ot* tho facts.
If, as Cicero implius in §41‚ Antonius had obtained the estates of
Rubrius by foul mouns, it was only natural that the heirs-at-law
should try to prevent his disposing· of them. It might be possible
some day to reeover them from Antonius : dispersed by sale amongst
a dozen or two of purchasers. it would be hopeless.

38. quo . . . habebat: above, xxv. 20.

39. quin: = quinetimu, “ nay, more.'' In this sense quin does not
affect the mood.

42. paucis . . . diebus: “having given you a respite of a few
more days in which to pay.'’

44. sequeris: sc. in Hispaniam, to the campaign which ended at
Munda, 45 B.c. rudem: the “staff” or “baton” which was pre-
sented, as a symbol of his discharge, to a gladiator who had earned
his retirement. The verb is easily supplied, eg. accepisti. By not
accompanying Caesar to Spain, Antonius made it seem that he had
‘⁴ taken his disc-harge.”

45. qui: the antecedentis hunc. fuerit: subjunctive in consecutive
(or perhaps causal) clause. in suis partibus: “in the interests of
his own party‚” on which depended his fortunes (in setis sommis).
In the sense of ‘⁴ party ’² or “ faction,’' partes is not rare, eff. xxx. 12.

ARGUMENT.—‹}§ 75-78. Caesar went to Spain. Why did yon not qo
too ? Γοιι started indeed, but you left it to houthem lo [so ancl do the
fiqlztinq. And you had far more reason than lte to fiylzt fin· tlte spoils
which you stood to lose if Pompeins’ sons could bnt Imm their own. Bne
you only μοι as far as Narbo, and then eume lcome aqam. What a
dramatic return Ι ἰυἱίΙι οη-ιζῇίεῑί head and slippcrecl feet, at dead of w'ylzt,
in dis-qnisffl and all to (sice (ι pleasant smyris-e lo your lutJy-.s·etfferinq
wife Ι Α pretty reason for scarinq all Rome ! Why, tlte very mobjecred
at the pretence.

ch. XXX. 1. aliquando tandem: a strong expression implying

that Antonius was very, very slow.

2. pervenire : ‘⁴ go tlte whole u·ay,’' this being the force of the pre-
fix. He only went as far as Narbo <line 18).

3. Dolabella : there is probably an allusion to his diminutive stature,
which was so very noticeable that Cicero once publicly asked him who
had tisd him so cleverly to his sword.
