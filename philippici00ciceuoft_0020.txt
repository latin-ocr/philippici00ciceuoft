10 INTRODUCTION.

the doubt subsisted then, we cannot hope to solve it now

murder of Caesar at the moment when the question was.
to be raised.

As to the goodness or badness of Caesar there in room
for dispute. But whether good or bad, he was undoubtedly
a great man3 this even Cicero himself confesses in an
eloquent eulogy (ᾖ 116). On the other hand⁷ as to his-
death there are no two opinions: “the foulest murder in -
all history '' is the almost unanimous verdict. Cicero, who*
had himself received nothing but consideration from the-
victim‚ tries in vain to glorify the crime. Philosophy, when
its votaries instead of 'being original philosophers, are-
mere eclectio dabblers, can and does blind those who indulge·
in it overmuch. It blinded Cicero and destroyed his moral
sense, just as it did that of M. Brutus and others of the-
conspirators. It is not possible to prove that any one of'
sixty or more conspirators had been injured by Caesar 3.
many of them owed their all to his indulgence. The
arch-conspirator, Brutus, Caesar had treated as his own
son. And not one of the niul-derers belonged to the really
great houses of the time, with whom the extinction of tho<
old Republic might legitiinately be a grievance. The
murder was the outcome of a mistaken philosophy which.
argued that the old way, however bad, was still the best
way: that Rome must be a Republic still, as she had been·
for five hundred years3 that if it was glorious to expel a
Tarquin, to kill a Cassius and a Maelius, it was glorious to·
kil] Caesar too. Such a creed was the negation of all pro·
grcss, but progressi is strengel· than creeds. It was-
stronger than the Libo-atores. Caesar represented progress.
He saw that the old re'lqz'me was no longer workable,
and he tried to replace it with a better. His only fault
was that he did not take sufficient pains to hide the com-
pleteness of the change. As a man of facts, he lacked
sentiment.

Casca. Their excuse was that Caesar had made himself
king: and the substance of the charge was found in the
