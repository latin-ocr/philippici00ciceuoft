INTRODUcssTloN.

gl. Marcus Tullius (licem, the greatest of Roman
orators, was born at Arpinum in 106 Rc. His family was
of equestrian rank, but had never held any office in Rome.
Cicero was accordingly a nocem homo, and his struggle to
obtain the praetorship and consulship was on that account
made harder. He was sent while still a young lad to
Rome, aud there studied under the best masters, such as
Archias. In 91 B.o. he assumed the {offla virilis, and then
attended the lecture-s of orators and lawyers. He was
entrusted by his father to the special care of Mucius
Scaevola, the Augur, from whose side he hardly ever
departed. At that time the easiest method of obtaining
civic fame and success was by means of oratory, and as
Cicero had a natural talent for this art, he cultivated it in
preference to devoting himself to a military life. However,
he served, as was usual with young· Romans who aspired
to public office, one campaign, and this happened to be
in the Soc-ia] War (89 Bo) under Cn. Pompeius Strabo,
the father of Pompey the Great. For the next six years
he took no part in public affairs, but devoted his time to
the study of rhetoric and the various schools of philosophy.

The first of his extant speeches is that Pro P. Quinctio,
which was delivered in 81 Rc. Two years later, in a
criminal trial, he defended Sextus Roscius Amerinus, whose
accuser was Chrysogonus, the powerful freedman of Sulla.
It was very bold in Cicero to undertake this defenee, but
his boldness was equalled by his eloquence ; and his success
on this occasion placed him at once amongst the best
orators of the day. Ill-health obliged him to retii-e to
Rhodes and Athens, where he continued his study of
rhetoric and philosophy for two years, returned to Rome

in 77 Β.0., and was elected quaestor for the year 75 Bc.
