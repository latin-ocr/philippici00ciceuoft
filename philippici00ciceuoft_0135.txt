south shore of Asia Minor from the Gulf of Issus (Skanderonm.) west-
ward to the confines of Lycia. It was constituted a province of Rome
in 64 B.c.‚ and was the sphere of Cicero's only provincial governorship,
51 B.c. In ξ) 26 Cicero mentions an otherwise unknown attempt upon
the life of Caesar by Cassius, which occurred at Tarsus on the river
Cydnus, presumably in 47 B.C.‚ when Caesar was moving from
Alexandria to meet Pharnaces of Pontus at the battle of Ziela.

Cimber, -bri, m. : L. Tillius Cimber, the son of a libertinus, was at
first a. partizan of Pompeius, but subsequently made his peace with
Caesar, who appointed him prospective governor of Bithynia. Never-
theless Cimber joined the conspiracy, and escaping to his province,
busied himself in raising forces for the Republican army which was
defeated at Philippi (εξ 27).

Cinna, -ae, m.: L. Cornelius Cinna, the colleague of Marius as
leader of the democrats against the Senate and Sulla (q.v.). Expelled
for the moment by Sulla in 88 B.C.‚ they instantly returned, seized
the city, and removed by proscription hundreds of their opponente
os the senatorial party. Marius died very shortly after, but Cinna
retained his despotic position for four years, until Sulla was already
about to return from the East, when Cinna’s troops deserted wholesale
to his rival and tore their commander to pieces at Ancona, 84 B.c.

§Clodium -i‚ m.: three persons of the name are mentioned in the
speech. (1) Sextus Clodius, a rhetorician under whom Antonius is
said to have studied and whom he is alleged to have rewarded with a
gift of 2000 iuqera of land at Leontini. According to Cicero his
teaching was not worth the price (ἕξ 8, 43). (2) Sextus Clodius, a
man of loose habits, and a political partizan of No. 3. He had
been banished in 52 B.C.‚ after his patron's murder, and Cicero alleges
that Antonius revoked his banishment, on the strength of a forged
memorandum of Caesar's (ᾧ 9). (3) Publius Clodius Pulcher, a
dissolute young patrician who was indictcd in 62 ΒΕ. for an alleged
profanation of the mysteries of the Bona Dea. Cicero, summoned as
a witness, was compelled to give evidence against Clodius, and this
fact the latter, although actually acquittcd, would not forgive. To
revenge himself on Cicero he got himself adopted into a plebeian qens,
and forthwith offered himself for the tribunate (which only plebeians
could occupy). Holding this office in 58 B.c., he at once moved a
bill which entailed Cicero’s banishment, as having illegally put to
death certain cives (viz. the Catilinarians). At first a supporter of
Caesar and Pompeius, he soon quarrelled with them, and stood forward
as a democratic agitator of the most violent and radical type. His
position was challenged by T. Annius Milo, representing the sena-
'torian party, and the quarrels of the two leaders filled Rome with riot
and violence. Cicero alleges that Antonius, when candidate for the
quaestorship in 53 Be, tried to murder Clodius (ᾧ 21) ; and he met
that fate in the next year at the hands of Milo (Q 21). Cicero further
alleges that all Clodius' violence was due to the promptings of
Antonius (ᾖ 48), for which there is no evidence at all. Cicero naturally
