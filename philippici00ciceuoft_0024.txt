14 INTRODUCTJON.

day 01 August. He had been infor-med that Antonius had
abandoned his dangerous courses and was all readiness to
act in eordial unisou with the Senate. But on reaching
Rome he was disgusted to learn that Antonius' principal
motion amongst the ayenda- for the day following (Sep-
tember lst) was to the effect that yet further tribute
should be paid to Caesar-'s inemory, by adding to all
supplicationes (days set apart 101· public prayer) an extra
‹lay in his honour. Cicero refrained from attending the
House, and Antonius, who knew that he was in Rome and
was irnpatient to learn what course he intended to adopt,
used some violent expressions about Cicero's indefinite
behaviour. On the next day, Cicero appeared in the House
and delivered his Fimt Pleileppz'o—an attempt to explain
away his own uncertainty 01 nieveinent, and a moderate,
but vigorous eoniplaint against Antonius⁷ general conduct.
By his own account he was anxious 101 a complete recon-
eiliation only. Antonius was not present, but in due
course he heard 01 the matter 01 the speech. On
September l9th he banislied any further illusions which
Cicero may have entertained, by delivering in the Senate
a virulent attack 011 Cicero. Cicero in his turn was absent
from the House 011 this oceasion; but he too soon knew
what had been said, and accepting the gage which the
vother had flung down, he replied in the Second Plzz‘leppz'e-
an invective which prudence prevented him 110111 actually
delivering, although he caused it to be published as his
reply to Antonius’ attack. The feud thus begun was only
terininated by the death 01 Cicero on December 7th, 43 13.c.‚
when he fell a victim to the infamous proscription by which
the Second Triumvirate-—Antonius, Lepidus, and Octavianus
Caesar—rid themselves 01 their several enemies. In the
interval he delivered twelve other Phe'lzpffl'cs—fourteen in
all—ainied 111016 01 less directly at Antonius; but it was
to the Second Phileppzfe that 116 owed his death. His head
and hands were nailed up upon the Bostra. in the Forum
as a war-ning to all against further use—or abiise—of the
ohl-fashimmd republican liberty of speech.
