47 nc. His Magister Equitum was Antonius. Cicero says
that this appointment was made “ without Caesar’s know-
ledge’' (ᾖ 62), which cannot be true. Antonius, however,
seems to have been making high-handed and rather
seandalous use of his opportunum& and of this fact,
douthess, Caesar was not aware. The overthrow of the
Pompeians led of course to confiscations‚ and Antonius
took the opportunity to buy in some desirable properties,
notably the villa of Metellus Scipio and the town-house of
Pompeius (ἓξ 62, 64). Cicero says that he never paid
for his purchases (ἐξ 71, 72), and that he was surprised
when Caesar demanded payment. He also says that
Antonius abused his powers as Maffl'ster Equitum (ξ 62),
making a feeble joke thereon. Antonius was certainly
hard up at this date, but such a fact was no more unusual
at that time than it is now.

Caesar was sole-consul in 45 no, and no other curule
magistrates were even elected. After Munda, when the
last of the Pompeian resistanoe was broken, it seemed
feasible to revert to a more normal form of administmtion,
and Caesar had given Cn. Dolabella reason to hope that he
should have the consulship of 44 Re. then the comitia
came, however, Dolabella was passed over⁷ and Caesar 111111-
self was returned with Antonius as his eolleague. Clearly‚
if there had been any ooolness between the two, it was now
ended. Dolabella revenged his disappointment by a
violent attaek on Antonius in the Senate House on New
Year’s Day (ἓ 79), and in retaliation Antonius, who was
at once augur and consul, publiely deelared that he would
prevent Dolabella⁷s eleetion as consul suffindas, although
Caesar (who intended to resign his own consulship before
leaving Rome for the East) had given his word that Dola-
bella should suceeed to the vaeaney so caused (ξ 80).
Antonius carried out his threat as far as he could: the
comitia returned Dolabella, and Antonius thereupon
deelared the eleetion invalid. Whether or not his veto was
to hold good even the Romans did not know. Cicero,
himself an augur, says 11 was illegaL but there was so much
of doubt in the matter that the point was down amongst
the ayencla of the Senate (ξ 88) 011 1116 Ides of March. If
