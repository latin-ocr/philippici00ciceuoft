abuses were put an end to by the law of Clodius, in 58 B.C., for which
see the note on line 28.

25. sacerdotii iure : ‘¹ by right of your office as an augur.’'

28. nos : ‘⁶ we augur-s,⁷' Cicero had been one of the College of Augure
since 53 13.C. The abusos (line 22, note) attending the auspicia had been
lcgalised by a Lex Aetia et Fufia, 156 Bc. They were puta stop to by
the tribune P. Clodius in 58 B.c.‚who passed a law forbidding the
magistrate to interfere with the course of the polling when once it had
commenced. The magistrate still retained the right of preliminary
spectio (and if he chose he might still “ see signs '' in the course of such
spectio) but he was compelled to call in an augur to give the nuntiatio ;
and though the augur (if it were made worth his while, or if the
magistrate's report of tho results of the spectio required it) was free of
course, obnuntiare, “to declare the auspices unfavourable,'’ and so to
cause the comitia to be postponed; yet when once the polling had
conimenced it was not lawful either to stop it on plea of ‘⁶ watching
the sky'’ or to cancel the result on plea of informality (for as the
auspicia had already been referred to the opinion of the augur in
attendanee, and the augur's decision was final, it was no longer
possible to plead either faulty spectio, or mistakcn nuntiatio). At the
present date therefore (44 B.c.)‚ as Cicero remarks, the angurs possessed
(as heretofore) only nuntiatio; whereas the magistrates, albeit they had
lost the nuntiatio, still retained the spectio. Now Antonius was both
an augur and a consul, 44 Rc. If he desired to prevent the election
of Dolabella he could do so in two ways: either (a) he could, as augur,
resort to obnmztiati0; or (b) he could, as presiding magistrate, employ
his powers of spectio. And inasmuch as spectio preceded nuntiatio, and
it was upon the spectio that the nuntiatio depended, it was obviously
simpler for him as augur to say that the signs seen were bad, and be
done with it ; than first, as consul, to perform the spectio, and secondly,
as augur, rule them bad; for he could not as augur make obnuntiatio,
unless as consul he had first “seen signs‚” or otherwise found the
spectio unfavourable.

29. etiam spectionem: the force of etiam is (not “spectio as well as
nuntiatio,’' but) “that even more necessary power of spcctio.'’ For
without the spectio of the magistrate there could be no nuntiatio of the
the augur. For the force of ctiam, cp. vi. 20.

33. auspiciis : by declaring that there was a vitium in the auspices.

34. quod fecit: he “saw a εἰς-ΠΝ Cp. xxxiii. 6, “atio dic'' inquit.
quisquamne . . . : the meaning is that, inasmuch as it is impossible to
know beforehand that the auspicia of any given day will be vitiata, a
person who declares that he means to find a fiaw in them is in effect
threatening to ‘⁴ see a sign.''

35. comitiis : ‘⁴ during the polling.''

36. per leges: the law of Clodius. See note on line 28.

37. comitiis habitis τ “ while the comitia isin p1·ogress‚'' the perfect
participle passive here doing duty for a present, as in Vergil's
Circensibus actis, “ while the circus games are being] celebrated.’'

39. inscientia: ablativo.
