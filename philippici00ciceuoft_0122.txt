112 CICERO, PHILIPPIO 11. [GH. XXXVIII·

9. ne sit . . . provincia: an exaggeration. The setting free from
taxation is lookcd upon as tantamount to giving up the province. Crete
was annexed as a province in 67 Rc. post M. Brutum pro consule:
“ after the governorship of the pro-consul M. Brutus.”

10. mentis compos: “master of your senses.'' The genitive is
objective. constringendus: “ to be put under restraint '' as a
lunatio.

12. nihil ad Brutum . . . pertineret: as Caesar had never allotted
Crete to Brutus, it was impossible to believe that he had arranged for
any innovations there “ after Brutus had been governor.” By Caesar's
arrangement, M. Brutus was to be governor of Macedonia. See note
on xiii. 14.

13. nihil actum : “that no harrn has been done.''

15. defuerit : perfect subjunctive, ordinary sequence in consecutive
clauses.

18. 'freditus aequatos: the Mss. have inquinatos, “polluted,”
“ tarnished‚'' for which aequatos, ‘⁶ cqualized‚'’ “treated as equal,'' is
an emendation. Caesar had allowed many of the Republican exiles to
return to Italy ; others hc had refused to treat with the same leniency.
It was these latter whom Antonius proceedcd to recall by forged
deerees. They were mostly men of dubious character, which explains
why firstly Cacsar would not restore them, and why secondly their
recall “ disgraeod'' better men (because the good and thc bad were
treatcd in precisely the same way, viz. pardoned).

23. habes in loco patrui: “treat as you treated your unele,” i.e.
in 49 Bss. »Sec xxiii. 1. He was ultimately recalled bv Caesar,
45 B.C. ferre: so. roqationem, “move for a law ’⁵ on his behalf.

26. risus: C. Antonius had been degraded by the Censors of 70 B.C.
For such a man to offer himself for the Censorship was therefore
as ridiculous as it was insulting. The train of thought is: you did
not think your uncle a fit person to be recalled from exile ; how then
did you darc suggest him as a suitable Censor for us?

27. comitia: the comitia censoria (elec-tion ot* consors). Antonius
failed after all to bring his uncle 10 the poll.

28. tribunus . . . nuntiabat: at munilia ibat on no other occasion)
thunder or lightning on the left was accounted a bad omen, bad enough
to stop the pelling. Under all other circumstances it was a good sign.
The tribunes of the plebs, albcit they were the lowest of the magistrates
having auspicia, could always stop a camilia hy the usual mcthods (de
eaelo servando, obnuntiando).

20. tua . . . tuorum: “yourself . . . your friends,'' an instance
of the two constructions (of the peremi or thing conccrned) regular
with imerest.

30. septemviram: a Board of Seven Commissioners, including
M. Antonius and his brothor Lucius, 10 make allotments of certain
lands 111 Italy and Sicily. This was one of Antonius) earliest acts on
Caesar-'s death, its purpose being to buy over the vclcrans ol' Caesar
(the allottecs) to his side.

31. destituisti: ‘⁶ dropped '³ him, “left him out.'’ intervenit:
