3. templo: the temple of Concord (ὁ 19). It stood at the extreme
N.W. end of the Forum, upon the lower slopes of the Capitoline Hill,
up which ran the road called Clivus Capitolinus. the upward continua-
tion of the l'ia Sacra. The Senate frequently met here instead of in
the senate-house (Curia).

7. quod tu non audeas: consecutive subjunctive. clivum Capitoli-
num: see the last note. Antonius had apparently charged Cicero
with intimidating the senate by means of armed slaves, on the
occasion of the famous meeting· of December 5, 63 B.c., at which the
Catilinarians were condemned.

9. servorum: it was unlawful to arm slaves for any purpose what-
ever, much more so for purposes of intimidation. illa nefaria senatus
consulta: i.e. the decrees by which the five conspirators who had
been arrested were condemned to death. Νςήινίἰ is either ironical, or
possibly a quotation froin Antonius' lips.

12. qui. . . loquare: subjunctive in causal clause depending on
mmer-

13. eques Romanus: the original equites of Rome were a limited
number (never more than 1800) of citizens, whose exceptional wealth
qualified them to bear the eost of the honourable service of cavalry.
But as carly as 133 B.c. they had ceased to perform any such service,
and at the present time the name included all citizens owning· property
to the value of 400‚000 sesterces, excepting those who belonged to the
ordo senatorius ,· and their numbers included practically the whole of
the merchants, bankers, and great moneyed interests of Rome. It
followed that they were of very great influence in politics.

16. in clivo Capitolino: they gathered there, partly out of anxiety
to hear the result of the debate in the Temple of Concord, partly to
protect the senators in case of any attempt at violence on the part ot
those who sympathised with the arrested Catilinarians. nomen . . .
dedit: women dare is “to give in one's name'’ as a. volunteer for
enrolment. On the occasion in question numbers of boni (zze. loyalists)
were enrolled for the protection οἱ the government.

17. quamquam: ‘⁴ and yet’⁷ (all did not give their names, because,
etc.) ; wc should say, ‘⁶ why, there were not clerks cnough.⁷' scribae :
the clerks who took the names of the volunteers. tabulae : the ‘⁶ books ''
or “ registers '’ in which the names of volunteers were entered.

18. capere: ‘⁴ to contain,'’ ⁵* to hold,'' a common meaning.

19. de patriae parricidio confiterentur: “owned to their plot to
destroy their country.'' The accusative and infinitive clause se con·
sensisse, is epexegetic or explanatory of de patriae parricidio. Parrici-
dium includes all abominable crimes, especially those which outrage
pietas, viz. the murder of a parent or betrayal of one's country. The
connection of the word with pater (-}-eaedo) is, however, dubious.
consciorum . . . coacti: they were “ constrained '' to confessby (l) the
information given by their supposed accomplices, the Allobroges,
