nected with virtus) means a manly man, not a coward.

14. ·i11ud Cassianum: “ the well-known question of Cassius.’' The
person referred to is L. Cassius Longinus, tribune of the people 137
B.c., a man famous for his strictness as a judge. cui bono fuerit:
literally “ to whom was it for a benefit ’ἓ ” i.e. ‘⁵ who got the benefit Ρ ”
The clause explains the preceding words illud Cassianum, bono being
predicative dative and fuerit subjunctive ot indirect question
dependent upon some verb of asking understood. Obviously the
first step in seeking to discover the author of an act, is to ask, ‘⁴ Who
gains by it?” the presumption being that the gainer is also the
contriver.

15. vide ne haereas: “ have a care that you be not at a loss.’' Op.
xii. 6. With this meaning of haerere, cp. the colloquial English “to
be stuck fast for an idea.”

18. aere alieno: ⁸⁴ other people's money,” zze. “ bon-owed money,”
and so “ debt.'' ad aedem Opis: Ops (“ Plenty'’) was the wife of
Saturnus, and their joint temple, standing close beside the temple of
Concord (vii. 3), was used for the Public Treasury. Shortly after
Caesar's death, Antonius seized all the money there deposited, to the

mentarii and chiroqraplza of the next sentence.

Introduction, 35 7. eivitatium: for the form of the genitive (dum for
-um)‚ cp. laudium, xii. 9.

24. nundinae: properly “ ninth day,” or “ market·day ” ; here
“ traffi(·king.'’

26. nescio quid conturbatus: ‘⁶ somewhat confused,” nescio in this
usage merely intensifying the force of the indefinite pronoun or
adjective, without affe(·ting the syntax. Videris is therefore present
indicative instead of subjunctive.

27. subtimes τ the force ot* the compound is “ have a sneakinq fear.’'
hoc crimen: the charge of conspiring against Caesar. As Antonius
profitted the most by it, he ought, says Cicero, according to Cassius’
test, to be the person responsible.
