INTRODUCTION. 5

Senate, for its part, hopcd to use Pompeius to rid it of
Caesar. It flattered him, and he succumbed to the fiattery,
particularly when (in 52 nc.) it appointed him sole consul
to deal with the disorders consequent upon the assassina-
tion of Clodius by Milo. He felt himself strong enough to
challenge Caesar. An account of the exact course of
the quarrel between the two is not needful here. It is
sufficient to explain that Pompeius' plan was to reduce
Caesar to the condition of a p}·z't·az‘zc3, a man without office,
in which condition he would be at the mei-cy of his enemies.
Caesar-'s aim was to prevent any such manoeuvres.
Pompeius, though nominally the head of the senatorial
party, was no statesman. He had neither resource, nor
tact, nor the cour-age of his opinions; nor could he com-

Caesar, on the other hand, had all these qualifications.
He had already filled Rome with energetic agents (amongst

Pompeius. Their well-meant efforts were overborne by
the more extreme anti-Caesarians. One after another all
attempts at conciliation were rejected by the extremists3
one after another the high-handed proposals of the
extremists were blocked by tribunes in Caesar-’s interest
or Caesar’s pay. The extremists finally forced through
the Senate the Senatus Consultant Ultimum <g 51), the
resolution which was customarily passed in crises 0‘1'
extreme domestic peril, and which was tantamount to
declar-ing martial-law, to branding Caesar as an outlaw, and
to bidding the consuls arm against him. The tribunes
Antonius and Cassius (S 51), having in vain exhausted all
constitutional means to prevent this step, believed, or
professed to believe, their safety imperilled, and fied to
Caesar at Ravenna, calling upon him to maintain the
sacrosanct rights of the tribunate. It was on this plea,
nominally, that Caesar crossed the Rubicon, and so doing
