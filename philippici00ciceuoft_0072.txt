TITLE.

Philippicarum: se. orationum. The name of “Philippics’' (i.e.
“concerning Philip'’) was originally applied to certain speeches of
the Athenian orator Demosthenes, in which he attached Philip of
Macedon, between the years 351-341 B.c. The name was hence trans-
ferred to the fourteen speeches in which Cicero more or less directly
attacks Antonius, or the policy of Antonius; not so much from any
resemblance in tone 01· language‚* as from the siinilarity between the
nolitia-al attitudes of the two orators. As Demosthenes represented
free Athens strnggling against the encroachments of King Philip, so
Cicero represented the free Republie struggling against the threatened
military despotism of Antonius. It was apparently Cicero himself
who first suggested the comparison ; for in a letter to Brutus (ii. 4. 2)
he says Video te delectari Philippicis nostris, “I see that you are
delighted with my ‘Philippics‚’ ’' and Brutus replies (ii. 5. 4), “I
give you my leave to call them indeed ‘Philippics‚⁷ as one of your
letters jestingly has it.’' The next allusion to the name is in Juvenal’s
Satires (x. 124), written about 100 AJ). :—

Ridenda poemata malo
Quam te conspicuae, divina Philippica, famae,
Volveris a prima quae proxima.

(“ I would sooner be the aecthor of tlte sorriest verses than of any speech
so flimous and so remarkable as the Second Pliilippic.”)

The name Orationes Antonianae or in Antonium, by which they
would naturally be styled in Latin, is only rarcly found.

³ The use of the terni ‘¹ a Philippic” in modern English, to denote a wild and
unmeasured hurnngue, generally of a violently pcrsonal character, is drawn not
from the “l'hilippics” of Demosthean but from those of Cicero, and more
particularly from his Second l'hilippic.
