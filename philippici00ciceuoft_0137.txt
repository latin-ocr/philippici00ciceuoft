he intrigued with Antonius to secure his restoration for an onormous
bribe, but in the meantime recovered his tetrarchy by force in the
confusion which followed Caesar‘s murder. Cicero had acted for him
in the Roman Oourts (45 B.C.)‚ when accused of plotting against
Caesar's life, in the still extant speech pro Deiotaro (ᾗ 93).

Dolabella -αθ, m. ε P. Cornelius Dolabella was husband of Cicero's
daughter Tullia. He fought on the side of Caesar with distinction at
Pharsalus, Thapsus, and Munda (ξ 75), being wounded in the latter
battle. His courage reeommended him to Caesar, who promised him
a consulship for 44 B.c. In the event, however, M. Antonius was
returned consul with Caesar, and Dolabella’s disappointment vcnted
itself in a furious attack upon Antonius in the Senate Honse on
January 1st, 44 B.c. Antonius in return avenged himself by threaten-
ing ‘⁸ to frustrate Dolabella's return at any subsequent comitia.'’ This
happened probably in February of the same year, when an electiori
was held to appoint a consul suffectus in lieu of Caesar, who intended
to resign the office. There was grave doubt as to the legality of
Antonius’ obstruction, and the question was to have been debated in
the Senate on the very day of Caesar's murder. Dolabella appears to
have taken office, however, after that event, without question, and.
showed considerable vigour in repressing disorder. Antonius pre·
sently won him over by transferring to him the province of Syria,
which he took from C. Cassius. On reaching his province in 43 B.c.
Dolabella seized and executed C. Trebonius, one of the Liberators.
For this the Senate declared him an outlaw, and Cassius, attacking
him with armed forces, compcllcd him to commit suicide (ἐξ 75, 79, 90).

Domitius, -i, m.: (1) L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, a leading· sena-
torian, killed by Antonius at Pharsalus (ᾧ 71). (2) Cn. Domitius
Ahenobarbus, son of the above, defended Massilia (Mus-semes) against
Caesar and Trebonius in 49 Bc. Ilis mother was Porcia, sister of the
M. Porcius Cato who killed himself at Utica. He was one of the
conspiratas, according to Cicero, though this is denicd by other
writers. If he was of their number he had the distinction of being
the only one of them who died a natural death; for he escaped from

Philippi, was restored to favour by both Antonius and Octavianus, and
finally died of fever (ᾧ 27).

F.

Figulus, -i, m. ι C. Figulus, consul 64 B.c.‚ supported the polioy of.
Cicero towards the Catilinarians (ᾗ 12).

G.

Gabinius, -i, m.: Aulus Gabinius, tribune 67 B.c., was governor
of Syria 56 B.C., when he used his opportunity to invade Egypt and
restore to the throne Ptolemy Auletes, who had been expelled by his
subjecte in 58 B.c. Inasmueh as the Senate had formally deereed that
no interference was permissible on Ptolemy’s behalf, and had obtained.
