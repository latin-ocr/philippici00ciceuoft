70 menno, PHILIPPIO 11. [en. Ν.

34. per me liceat: per me lieet tibi means “ yon have my permission.''
quendam : another Sextus Clodius (not the rhetorieian of iv, 21,
above), a creature ot' the famous Publius Clodlus. He had been
banished in the year of the latter’s death <52 B.C.), and in connection
with the sanie crime, viz. the riots attending the murder of Clodius
b ' Milo.

>36. quid . . . me interponerem: see onnon venirem, ii. 2.

37. quem: the antec-edent of quem is contained iu tuae, the pos-
sessive adjective taking the place of a genitive (teci).

39. quid erat quod: “ what reason had you to.'’ With this phrase
in this sense the subjunctive (final) is always used in prose.

40. caesaris lege: in the letter to Cicero in which Antonius asks
for Cicero’s approvnl of the proposed recall of Sextus Clodius, he
alleg-cs that he had already obtained Caesar's consent ; and in l'hilippio
ΙΙ. iii„ Cicero makes Antonius declaro that Caesar had actually passed
a law expressly reeulling Clodius. lf this were so, he says, why ask
for my consent?

41. meam gratiam: we should say “ thanks to me.” in quo: “ in
a cnse in which ” there could be no thanks due to him. lege lata:
the ablativo absolute has either a causnl οι· a conditional force, ‘⁶ seeing
that (or if) the alleged law had really been passed (by Cnesnr)‚’' for in
that case it was Caesar alone to whom thanks were due. As Antonius
could himself get no credit with Clodius for reculiing him, he did not
mind (says Cicero) making Cicero a present of the eredit which was
not his to give. It was a case of “ thank you for nothing,’' so far as
Cicero was concerned.
