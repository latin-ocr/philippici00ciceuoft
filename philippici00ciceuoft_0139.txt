M.

Milo, -t'nlis, m. ; Τ. Annius Milo, sm. CLODIUS.

Murena, -ae, m. : L. Licinius Murena supported Cicero's policy in
63 13.C.‚ being at the time consul-designate for the following year
(ᾧ 12). He was prosecuted in the autumn of 63 B.C. for bribery, and
successfully defended by Cicero.

P.

Piso, -fmis, m.: C. Calpurnius Piso, colleague of Glabrio in the
consulship of 67 B.C.‚ supported Cicero against the Catilinarians
(§12). Cicero successfully defended him when prosecuted for mis-
conduct in his governorship of Narbonese Gaul.

Pompeius, -i, m. : Cn. Pompeius Magnus came to the frent in the
Civil NVar of 83-81 B.C.‚ as a partizan of Sulla and the Senate. He
gained further eredit sor putting down the abortive rising of the
democrat Lepidus (78-77 B.c.')‚ and the long-standing revolt of Sertorius
in Spain (76-71 B.O.). Returning to Rome, he finished the slave-war
with Spartacus (71 B.C.). Then, finding that the Senate was unwilling
to grant him a triumph for his Spanish exploits, he turned democrat,
and led a revolution which undid all the work of the Sullan restoration
(70 B.c.). As part of this plan he encouraged Cicero to prosecute
Verres in the same year, and the orator believed that he owed to
Pompeius this his first great success in public life. Hence the more
or less lasting alliance between the two. In 07 Rc. Pompeius was
commissioned to put down the Pirates of Cilicia, and succeeding easily
in this task, was further entrusted with the conduct of the war with
Mithradates of Pontus (66-63 n.c.). This ended, he returned to
Italy, and a second time finding the Senate untractable, joined Caesar
and Crassus in the First Triumvirate (60 Β 0.). 'she further career
of Pompeius is narrated in the Introduction. Cicero was in
nothing more consistent then in the loyalty with which be held by
PompeiuS, so long as the latter's conduct made it possible; and he
claims that, even when they diffcred in politics, they still remained
excellent friends. Pompeius’ ability as a general and strategist was
great, his activity untiring; but he was no statesmrm, was quite
unable to govern except by the aid of military law, and in ventui-ing
to quarrel with Caesar completely miscalculated his opponent's
strength.

S.

Servilius, -i, m.: (1) Publius and Gaius Servilius, two of the
Liberators (ᾧ 27). They claimed descent from (2) C. Servilius Ahala,
Master of the Herse to Cincinnatus, when the latter was deelared
Dictator to deal with Spurius Maelius (439 Bc), a wealthy
plebeian who, for the liberality wherewith he distributed corn to the
