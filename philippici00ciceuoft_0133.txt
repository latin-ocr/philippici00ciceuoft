who aided in the murder of Caesar. (1) L. J unius Brutus, first consul
of Rome, 510 B.c. See the note on xi. 15, and also xliv. 33. (2)
M. Junius Brutus, the Liberator. He claimed descent on the mother’s
side from Servilius Ahala (qm.) , who saved Rome from the alleged attempt
of Sp. Maelius to make himself king, 439 B.c.; and on the father-'s
side was populzuly, but wrongly, believed to be descended from the
patrician L. Brutus, who expelled the Tarquins. Originally a sup·
porter of Pompeius, he fought at Pharsalus, and owed his life to
Caesar, who pardoned him, and advanced him to the office of praetor
urbanus for 44 B.c. Brutus, however, was led by a mistaken
philosophy, and by the suggestions of friends who remindcd him of
what his ancestors had done for “ freedom‚⁷' to fancy that it was his
duty to rid Rome of Caesar, and thus became the nominal leader of
the conspiracy. After the murder he left Rome, and presently with-
drew to the province of Macedonia, originally allotted to him by
Caesar, in defiance of the various new arrangements by which
Antonius had sought to obtain that province for himself or his allies.
In Macedonia he raised the Republican army which was destroyed at
Philippi (42 B.c.), Brutus committing suicide after his defeat. He
married Porcia, sister of M. Porcius Cato Uticensis. (3) Decimus
Brutus, a relative of No. 2, was also one of the conspirators, and
governor-designate of Gallia Cisalpina. He endeavoured to maintain
himself in that province against Antonius, but was shut up in Mutina
(lilodena), and presently compelled to fly. While attempting to reach
M. Brutus in Greece he was seized and put to death by a Gaulish chief
named Camelus. Like No. 2, he claimed descent from the family of
Servilius Ahala (gl 16).

caesar, -aris, m.: (1) 1.. Julius caesar, a cousin of the Dictator,
was consul 64 B.C. His sister Iulia married (a) M. Antonius Creticus,
father of the Triumvir, to whom he was therefore related as uncle by
marriage (aremulus-Q (b) P. Lentulus Sura, the catilinarium. He is
mentioned in (ξ 14 as a leading supporter of Cicero's action in regard
to the conspiracy of 63 B.c.‚ although this attitude compelled him to
vote for the execution of his own brother-,in-law. (2) G. Julius
caesar, the Dictator. See Introduction.

cassius, -i‚ m.: (l) spurius cassius, the legendary author of the
League of Rome with the Latius, was accuscd of aiming at the
kingship and was put to death on that ground probably by his own
father (§§ 26, 114) in the year 486 Bc. (2) c. cassius Longinus, the
Liberator, claimed to be descended from the same family to which
No. 1 belonged. A partizan of Pompeius, he owed his life to
Caesar‘s clemency after Pharsalus, yet he joined the Liberators, and
ranked with his brother-in-law, M. Brutus, as a ring-leader in the
conspiracy. He was praetor peremimus for that year, with Syria as
his prospective province, but Antonius cancelled this appointment,
substituting a commission to control the corn-supply, with Cyrene, as
