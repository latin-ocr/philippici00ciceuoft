commanded the peninsula from the north: Macedonia inter-
rupted communications between Rome and her eastern
provinces: Syria, Asia, and Bithynia, commanded the
entire eastern frontier and the enormous food resources
of Egypt as well. Moreover, the provinces east of the
Adriatic had been the chief supporters of Pompeius, and
were still in the main devoted to the senator-ian, w. the
republican, interest. It was desirable to remove the
Liberators from such dangerous positions. Antonius pro-
ceeded to disarm them in detail. By means of further
forged aeta Caesaris he obtained a law transferring the
Syrian command of Cassius to Dolabella, now acting
harmoniously with Antonius as consul szqffeetus, the Mace—

Nevertheless the proposals were duly made law, though
the Liberators continued to treat them one and all as null
and void. An armed collision between them and Antonius
was evidently in the immediate future.

Antonius. He had, so he believed, done all he could to
rally the senatorial party and encourage them to take a
firm attitude against all encroaehments. But the task had
proved too much for him, and in the early summer he too
left Rome, pledging himself, however, to be back in the
Senate House on the first day of the New Year. He
presently resolved to start for Greeoe, and actually em-
barked with that purpose3 but rough weather frustrated
his purpose—he was a bad sailor—-and landing again, he
discarded all his pla-ns and returned to Rome on the last
