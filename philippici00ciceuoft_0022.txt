that no aeta Caesaris should be taken into account if
<lating later than March 15th.

But it very soon became evident that Antonius was aiming
at the very power from which Caesar had fallen. He took
advantage ot' his position as consul, and of the fact that he
had secui-ed all Caesar’s papers, to drive a trade in alleged
aeta Caesaris, which he caused to be forged in return sor a
consideration. The civitas was given away, immunitas
(exemption from taxation) was granted to at least one
province (Crete) en blac, preferments and privileges were
openly sold, exiles were reeallcd and pardons provided for
all who cared to buy them (ἐξ, 6, 97). Fui-ther, to secure
to his side the veteran troops whom Caesar had called out
for the projected Parthian campaign, he caused an
Agrai-ian Law to be passed, under cover of which he made
assignnients of the small remnant of asser publicus in Cam—
pania and at Leontini in Sicily. If Cicero’s account be
true, he even re-allotted lands which had been aheady
disposed of, and did not hesitate to include his personal
friends among-st the recipients (gg 101, 102). In pursuance
of this plan he spent most of April and May in another
Italian tour, in which his conduct was marked, according
to Cicero, by every form of dissipation and insolence. It
was only at the end of May that he returned to Rome
(ἓξ 100, 107).

The Liberators in the interim had disappeared. These
amongst them to whom provincial governorships had been
allotted, in accordance with the acta Caesaris, withdrew to
their respective provinces, D. Brutus to Cisalpine Gaul,
C. Trebonius to Asia, and L. Tillius Cimber to Bithynia.
The two ringleatlers M. Brutus and C. Cassius were re-
spectively praedor urbanus and praetor pereffl·e'nus for the
current year, but not (lai-ing to reappear in Rome, they
were fain to receive special permission from the Senate to
absent themselves for a time (ξ 31). In due course they
hoped, at any rate, to take up their respective provincial
commands in 43 ae, viz.‚ Brutus that of Macedonia, and
Cassius that of Syria.

The provinces above named were all wealthy, and
all of first-class strategio importance. Gallia Cisalpina
