2 INTRODUCTION.

He served this office at Lilybaeum in Sicily, and acquired-

golden opinions srom the natives through his integrity,
impartffllity, and sels-denial. In 74 B-O. he returned to
Rome and again devoted himself to his profession as an
advocate. In 70 nc. he undertook the impeachment of
Verres, who was charged by the Sicilians with having been
guilty of misgovmnment, oppression, and extol-tion when
Quaestor in Sicily 73-71 B-C. The result of Cicero's

without even attempting a defence.

In politics Cicero was a fairly consistent member of the
senatorial party, or party of the nobles (Opte‘mates). The
Opposition was the Democratic party, or party of the

and consulars3 it had branches in many Italian towns3 its

violence and substitute a Democratic government3 and
from the name of its leader, it was known as the Catilin-
arian conspiracy (see Index, s·..v (mmm). Cicero by
means of spies kept himself informe-d ot¹ all its niovements,
and at the close of 63 Bc. suddenly arr-ested five of the
leading (winispirators. A few days lator, acting upon the
expressed opinion of a majority of the (senate, he had
them executed, although as Roman citizens they were
oxeinpt froin such punishment. The remainder‚ attempting
to carry out their plans by force of arnis, were defeated at
Pistoria (02 Bc), where Catilina foll.

‘from tho noblest (sens in Rome, in fact from the legendary
Iulus, the son ot* Aeneas. He was closely connected by
