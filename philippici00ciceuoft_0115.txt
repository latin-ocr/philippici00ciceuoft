41. Idus Martias: the date of Cacsar-'s murder.

42. apparitor ε 1113 attendant (011101- than a lictor) or servant of. any
magistrate. 'l'he consul Antonius, chief magistrate of the Republio,
playcd the sole of apparitor to Cacsar, says Cicero, though Caesar was
legally only his cquul (collcffu).

43. aversam lecticam: *⁶ the rear of Caesar's litter.’‘ For lectica,
see xxiv. 2. It was big enough to lie down in, and the rider's head
would naturally bc at 1113 rearmost eud, at which therefore Antonius
pushed lu his own head, to whisper his petitions.

oh. XXXIII. 1. Dolabellae comitiorum : “of the pelling for Dola-
bella.” The (11113 13 not known z it was somewhere between ‹lanuary
lst and March 15th, 41 Rc. The clection of consuls took place in
Comitia Cenem-iata. The Comitia Centuriam consisted of the Roman
People assembled by centurics and classes. It was originally intro-
duced by King Servius Tullius, but in the course of time it had been
very greatly moditicd. At the present date there were still 5 classes,
dividcd into 193 centuriae. Of these 89 (including the 18 centuriae
equitum) belonged 10 the classis prima, leaving 104 centuriae to the
remaining classes. Now as the total number of votes was 193, an
absolute majority was 97 3 and supposing the classis prima (= 89 votes)
to vote unanimously, it was only needful to secure 8 111013 votes of the
remaining centuriae in order to secure victory at the poll (89 -1- 8 = 97).
On the present occasion the entire 89 centuriae of the first class voted

for Dolabella. ln its turn the second class proceeded to poll, ·

and polled on the same side. ›Suddenly Antonius, in virtue of his
powers as augur, declarcd the comitia off, on the scere of “signs
seen ” : in other words, he waited as long as he dared in the hope that
Dolabella might after all be defeated; but finally attempted to stop
the polling- when his election was practically, if: not actually, a
certaint .

2. noxiiitio praerogativae: sc. centuriae, “there was then the pro-
cess 01 selecting by lot (or ballotting for) the praerogative century,’'
i.e. the century which should first record its vote. 'l'he Romans
regarded the result of this ballot with extraordinary superstition,
believing it to be the direct assei-tion 01 the will of heaven; and in
many cases the entire comitia simply followed the lead given by the
praeroqatira. The centuria praeroyativa was chosen by lot from the
first class, exeluding the 18 centuriae equinam· hence it would. be
01103311 from 71 centuries (89 — 18). Now if Antonius was
resolved to prevent the return of Dolabella at all costs, legal or
megel, he had two courses open to him. (a) Firstly‚ he might
declare the comitia off, as soon as he knew which centuria had been
ballotted to aet as praeroqativa.· for under the elaborate electoral
system of Rome, and its still more elaborate systems of bribery and
party organisation, he must have been well aware how that particular
centuria would vote, viz. for Dolabella. By interfering before it had
actually recorded its vote, he might perhaps have kept within the law,
and he would certainly have avoided a great deal of ill-feehng. But
