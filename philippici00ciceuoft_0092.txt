of the simple positive ‹hiemem—‘⁴ somcwhat like a dilimma ’' instead ot
bluntly ‘⁶ in the form of a dilemnia.''

22. retexo: ‘⁴ unweave, ” and so ¹⁶ retract ’ ' or “ withdraw. '’ So rqfiqo
= ‘⁴ unfasten,’' recludo = “ open. '' scribam: the order is scribam ad
illos ut ne cni neyent, si quisvrte quaerent, sitne verum, quod. . . obiectum
est. Ut ue is not seldom found in lieu of ne only. Scribo in meaning
= mpero, and therefore takes the construction of that verb.

25. celatum z sc. esse, me being the subject to the infinitive and the
object being left unexpressed, “ the fau-t that Ι was kept iu ignorance
(of the plot).''

27. pro : an exclamation, and independent of the syntax.

30. consilii societatem: see on xi. 5, note. in equum Troianum:
alluding to the sablo that Troy was at last captured by the stratageni
of the XVooden Herse, enclosed within which the picked warriors of
the Greeks made their way into the town. To have been admitted to
the conspiracy, says Cicero, was a compliment as great as to have been
selected to jein the heroes who entered the XVooden Herse.

32. quoquo animo facis : ‘¹ whatever your reason for doing so.”

255. expulsos: bunished from Italy. relegatos: sent a certain dis-
tance from Rome without loss of civic rights.

37. qui . . . videatur: consecutive subjunctive (qui = uc is). So
in the next sentences, quc? . . . putent, qaae . . .pr0seqnanlar.

41. litterae: “literature’' that is, the various ‘⁴ histories '⁸ of the
event, which were still to be written.

ch. XIV. 2. ne non probes: “ that you may decline to approve ’' ;
mm with probes forms one predication‚ stronger than the simple com-
pound improbes.

4- stilus : the word has two senses, (1) the usual sense of ‘⁴ a pen,'’
(2) the rarer one ot “a dagger,'‘ ep. Italian “ stiletto.’' Cicero here
puns upon the double meaning. The Roman ‘⁴ pen ” was a straight
piece of metal with one end pointed, for incisiug the letters upon the
tablets of waxed wood (puydlares) which formed the usual writing
material, the other end fiattened to a broad square edge, for erasing
and re-smoothing the wax.

5. actum . . . fabulam: Cicero implies that, by simply murdering
Caesar, the assassins left their work unfinished. It should have been
completed by the further murder of Caesar's henchman Antonius.

7. Narbone: ablative of place where. Narbo Marcius, now Nar-
honne, on the shore of the Gulf of Lyons, west of Mul-seille& was
the capital of the province of Gallia, Narbonensis, roughly correspond-
ing to Provenee. Trebonius had sounded Antonius upon the subject
ot Caesar's murder, at Narbo, in the preceding wvcar, 45 R.C. Antonius
had refused to have anything to do with the mutter, und this explains
why Trebonius at the moment of the murder, took steps to get
Antonius out of the way (sevocare). It also proves Cicero's assertion,
