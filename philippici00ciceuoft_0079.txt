011. 1v.] sores. 69

12. quid habes quod . . . opponas: ‘¹ what have you that you could
reply to me.'’ The sentence breaks off with a digression <homo diserte
. . . defensurus), and is presently resumed and completed in quid opponas
tandem, si neqem. In the first instance, however, opponas is a conse-
cutive subjunctive (quod = tale uc id), in the latter it is hypothetical.

13. ut Mustelae . . . videris: the clause takes up the sarcastic
epithet diserte. Tiro and Mustela were two of Antonius' low—class
supporters and bullies. Cicero says: Creatures like those doubtless
think you a elever speaker (zsse. for the virulence of your attack upon
me), and if you can justify their presence here Ι too will think you
a elever pleader. The force of tamen (Η at least ’') is that a Mustela
and a Tiro at any rate thought Antonius eloquent, if better men did
not.

14. cum gladiis: this was illegal‚ above all in the presence of the
Senate. See on iii. 32.

16. inter sicarios: zle. if they were to be put upon their trial for
assassination (sicarius = one who uses a sica, or dagger). It is ini-
plied that they could have no other purpose in going about armed.

18. convincas: hypothetical subjunctive, sc. si neyenz, etc.

19. chirographo: “han‹lwri1i11g.'' But in xxxviii. 2, the meaning
is “autograph-writings!² scientiam quaestuosam: “a skill which
brings you in 1noney,'' alluding to the suspicion that Antonius had
for money forged various documents purporting to be in Caesar's
handwriting.

20. qui possis: qui is the archaic ablative of quis interrogative,
‘⁶ how Ρ ” librarii manu: sc. scripta, “ (written) in my amanuensis’
hand.'’ Most literary men employed educated slaves to write from
their dictation.

21. magistro: a rhetorician named Sextus Clodius, to whom
Antonius gave 2000 jugera (about 1500 acres) of land in Sicily as a
reward for his teaching. See χῖ 43, to which quantam iamprusbram
refers. “ I wish I could get as much for teaching anyone to act like
a fool!” says Cicero. qui. . . doceat: the clause is cuusal, and
therefore the verb is in the subjunctive.

23. oratoris . . . hominis: prodicative gonitives.

25. in isto ipso: i.e. in publishing the letter.

26. inhumanitatis: the customary genitive of the charge after a
verb of accusing or condemning. »So amentiae.

29. crimen: in its original and proper sense of “ accusation.''

30. existimem: subjunctive of reported cause, giving tho reason
present in Ausonius-⁹ mind. So scribam. †se1·ibam: see last note.
Some editions read scribebam, but thero is no sufficient cause why one
of the two reasons offered should be represented as Antonius' if the
other is not.

32. poteram: “1 might,'’ sc. si vellem, “if 1 chose.’' This is a
good instance of the rule that possum (like debeo and some other
verbs expressive of ability, duty, etc.) are, in the apodosis of con-
ditional sentences, regularly constr-acted in the indicative, where other
verbs would require the subjunctive.
