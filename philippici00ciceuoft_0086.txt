7. at Miloni: at here means “whereas‚” contrasting Cicero's
seelings towards Milo, the actual murderer of Clodius, with those
which he had entertained towards Antonius, the would-be murderer.
Below, however, ix. 9, 11, at has the peculiar force explained in
ii. 10.

8. prius quam . . . suspicaretur: the subjunctive is used after
priusquam and antequam whenever the action expressed by its clause
is prenented or (when the principal sentence is negative) secured.
Thus, in the present instance, Milo is represented as purposely killing
Clodius ⁴⁶ before any one could foresee it.''

10. scilicet : strongly szwcustio, as often.

13. quamquam: resumptive, as in iii. 2. The suggestion is, that
if Cicero had been in any way responsible for, or unduly pleased at,
the murder, there would have been ample opportunity to tax him
with it when the case was tried (52 B.C.).

14. non satis prudenter: the trial of Milo for the murder ot
Clodius was conducted under a special law (the Lex Pompeia de ri)
passed by Pompeius, then sole consul, to secure greater despatch.
It was, therefore, a vom leae, and Cicero says the wisdom of sus-h a
procedure was doubtful, seeing· that the existing· laws (eff. the Lea:
Plautia de ri) furnished ample provision for dealing with the case.

20. quod: direct object of dicere, amplifiod by thc following clamem
opera . . vmtnm.

21. Caesaris amicitia: “friendship willa Cnesar.” So Caesaris

‘⁴ intimacy with nie‚'' which shows the genitive to be really possessive.

22. bellum civile: the civil war which connnenced with Caesnr's
passage of the Rubicon, 49 B.C., and ended with the final overthrow
of the Pmnpeians (Republicans) ut Munda, 45 B C.

23. maximum: ‘⁶ ot' most iinportance.'’

24. temporibus: “in (the mutter of) datos? Jee and temporibus are
ablativos of respect (a variety of the ‘⁵ local '’ amative).

4. felicior : in its usual senso of ·‘ Iuckicr ⁰

6. totum: :ulverbial use of totns, ‘⁶ eutiwlyffy

7. conarer: deliberative subjunctive. stulti . . . impudentis:
predis-titire genitive& cp. iv. 23. erat: ⁴‘ it would hai-o been (or it
werc)‚'' an idiomatie use of the Latin indicative, asin the phrases
Imtslnm est dicere, “it were a long mutter to tell‚” melius est tacere,
‘⁶ it were better to be silent.’'

9. suaserim: according· to rule. we should huve expected nn
historic tonso in the verb of the d‹=pon‹h·11t clause answcriug to the
historic tense (ineidermzli in the vcrb of tlu- principul clause. But in
