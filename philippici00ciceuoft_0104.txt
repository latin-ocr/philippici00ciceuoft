that of the army which supported nim (retermzis, line 15). lubrica:
·· slippery,'' hence “dangerous.''

15. veteranis cautum esse: ‘⁴ (we desire that) all care be taken of

20. me non occidisti: see above iii. 5, sqq.

23. vestris . . . legionibus: an excellent example of the ‘⁴ dative of

24. fac: iii. 9, note.

27. †1icuitne: “your insults did not permit me to keep in mind
this kindness, as I tried to keep it in mind, especially as (on tlze top of
stom· other z‘nszclts) 1 knew you would adopt your present violent coursc.''
The meaning is: I acknowledge that your sparing my life made me
