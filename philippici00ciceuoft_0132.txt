withdrew, and collecting what troops he could, marched into Cisalpine
Gaul to wrest that 1110111166 from the Liberator D. Brutus, whom he
speedily shut up within the walls of Matina (Modena). The consuls
of 43 B.C. received orders to relieve Mutina, which they succeeded in
doing at the eost of their own lives, Antonius withdrawing into
Transalpine Gaul. A few weeks later 116 returned with Aemilius
Lepidus, and at Bononia (Bolossna) met Octavianus. The three formed
a Triumvirate 101· their own ends, and, marching upon Rome, seized
the reins of government. The leading scnatorians were prosmibed,
Cicero being amongst the victims. In the following year, at Philippi
in Macedonia, M. Brutus and (J. Cassius were defeated aad slain, and
opposition to the Triumvirate broken. The Triumvirs now divided
the Empire amongst themselves, but Lepidus was speedily got rid of,
and by a further arrangement Octavianus took Italy and the 117651,
while to Antonius fell the Eastern portion of the Empire. This
included Egypt, whose queen Cleopatra speedily fascinated Antonius
to such a degree that 116 not only neglected his governmental duties,
but made her his queen and (so it was said) proposed to confer Roman
provinces as kingdoms upon her various sons. Octavianus found
herein an excuse for attacking his rival, 31 B.C. The two met at
Actium, on the west coast of central Greece. There Antonius and
Cleopatra, with a vast Egyptian fieet, were completely defeated, and
their land-forces at once joined the conqueror. Antonius ficd back
with Cleopatra to Alexandria, where both committed suicide. The
picture whah Cicero (111115 of Antonius must be accepted with
caution. There 15 no doubt that 116 was often unscrupulous, always a
