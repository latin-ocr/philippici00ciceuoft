but it is a probablc conjecture that thc [lc-fondant in the suit was him-
self one of the libertini (sec ii. 7), for Cicero suggests that Antonius
by protecting him sought to curry favour with that infimus ordo, and
that Cicero's client was his friend Sicca. nescio quando: “at some¹
time or other,'’ “ goodness knows when.’' The expression (like
neseio quis, etc.) implies that the affair was too trivial to waste timo
over. See the note on xiv. 26.

2. an . . . non venirem: “ought I not to have gono, etc.?'’ or,
“ was Ι not to have gone?⁷’ The subjunctive is in reality jussive,
although when used intcrrogatively it is often styled deliberative,
or dubitative. iste: “ my antagonist '⁷ i.e. Antonius. Iste is
normally used in oratory for the other party to the case, whether
prosecutor, defendant, or simply opponent, as hcre.

5. intercessoris: intercessio is ‘⁵ veto,’' the power of obstructing
all proceedings of governmcnt, justice, cte„ by simply forbidding
them. This power was inherent in all inagistracies, but in particular
it was the foundation of the powers of the tribune. Hence inter-
cessor here = tribumts. Apparently Antonius, sccing that his protege
was likely to be worsted, bribed a tribune to veto all further pro-
ceedings in the case. Such use of the veto was of course a misuse of
power, and this is what iniquissimi means.

6. iure praetorio: the praetors corresponded somewhat to our Chief
Justices, and the “ practorian law ’³ (praetorium ius), i.e. that body of
precedents, etc„ which was accumulated during the long working oi
the praetors' courts, was the normal “law '³ of Rome. If the
praetors' verdict had said that Antonius’ protege was in the right, the
verdict would have been a justification for Antonius' attitude; but by
preventing the giving of any verdiet, i.e. by preventing the
“ practorian law '’ from taking its course, Antonius in effect admitted
that he himself and his client were in the wrong.

7. infimo ordini : ἐι. the freedmen (libertini 01· liberti). These were
persons who, having been born slaves, had bcen freed by their owners.
They were very naturally despised by the genuine Roman citizens,
and marriage with one of their number was looked upon as a
deoradaffion.

ὃ. nepotes: after this word some editions insert the name Q. Fauni.
Q. Fadius was the father of Antonius’ first wife Fadia, and a
libertinus. It has been thought that he was the person protcctcd by
Antonius against Sicca. fuisse: “had been‚’' so long as Fadius was
alive (not so long as they wcre alive).

10. at enim: used with its customary force to introduce the statement
oi an objection advanced by an opponent. So also at alone ; (3.9. iii. 1,
ix. 9. in disciplinam . . . tradideras: “put yourself under my
teaching.'’ Young Romans who desired to enter public life attached
themselves to older men of repnte, accompanying them to the law
courts and elsewhere, and so learning the routine of law, public
business, etc.

11. ne tu. : ne is the particle of emphasis (“ verily‚’' ‘⁴ of a truth ”),
and has nothing to do with the conjunction ne. It is usually joined,
