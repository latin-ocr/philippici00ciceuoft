were the highcr magistrates. The augurs could not do so; their
power was liinitcd to the giving of an opinion (if requestcd) upon tho
nature of the auspices in any given case; and while on the one hand
thcir ruling was absolute and unalterablc. on the other hand they
could give no opinion unless formally invited to do so. They were
practically a Court of Appcal. 'J'he process of taking· the auspices was
termed spectio (line 30): thus auspicia habere ‹lisfcrs from spectionem
hnbcre‚· the former meaning simply “ to be qmelisted to calce tlze auspices
should occasion arise‚” and the latter denoting the actual taking of
the auspices on any given occasion. The auspices having been duly
taken (spectione habita) by the magistrate, the result was formally
announced. Such announcement was termed nuntiatio (line 28), or, if
the result was unfavourable, obnuntiatio. If the magistrate under-
took the spectio unassisted, he naturally made the nuntiatio himself.
If on the other hand. as often, hc called in an augur to assist him in
the spectio, the nuntiatio or obnuntiatio rested with the augur. But
the augur as such had neither auspicia nor spectio. Now the validity
of any public act depended upon the auspices being (a) correctly
taken, and (h) favourahle. If the auspices were unfavourable‚
nothing could hedone, and the matter had to be postponed to
another day (alio die was the formula used, xxxiii. 6). If again
there had been any flaw or informality (vitium) in the spectio, the
subsequent act was of course invalidated (vitiare, line 23). And the
only persons who had power to determine whether such vitium
had occurred were the augurs. Herein lay the secret of the
great importance of the Auynratns. A corrupt augur could always be
prevailcd upon for a consideration to declare that the auspices had
been improperly taken, or to give an unfavourable report (obnuntiatio)
if he were called in to attend at the spectio. His assistance was there-
fore invaluablc to political parties above all in eleetoral matters;
for by the augur’s assistance his party, could control the action
of any comitia, either (a) by preventing the taking of the poll (comitia
impedire, line 23) on the plea that the auspices were nnfavourahle‚ or
(b) by cancelling the result of the poll (comitia vitiare, line 23) on the
plea that there had been a flaw in the spectio. It was because of
this great politicae value of the (tuyzcratus that the nobles took such
great pains to keep it in their own control, and such eminent
men (ey. Cicero himself and Caesar) were anxious to attain to it.
In Cicero's time only one class of auspices was consulted, viz.
caelestia, signs in the heavens, such as thuncler‚ lightning. etc. Hence
de caelo servare (line 36), “to watch the sky ” (for lightning. etc)
But this led to still further abiise. The magistrate presiding (ΝΒ.-
not an augur, unless the magistrate happened to be augur as well) at a
comitia could at any moment stop the polling by declaring that he had
“ watched the sky '’ (sert-asse de veto), for no one could challenge the
truth of his assertion. Whence it followccl that, if he desired to
prevent any coniitial am it was only needful for him to annolmce
beforehand that he intended to ‘⁴ watch the sky‚’' which was tanta-
mount to declax-ing that he meant to stop the proceedings. These
