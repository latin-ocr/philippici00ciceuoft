Ch. XV. 1. castra . . . Pompei: “what happened in Pompeius’
(1111111).Π So illud omne tempus, ⁶· all that beffell in those days.’' Cicero
actually joined Pompeius in Epirus, and remained in camp with him
for some weeks, before he marched out towards Pharsalus.

3. consilium auctoritasque : he appears to have counselled peace at
any price, but as a matter of fact he had no practicable suggestions to
make, and querulously found fault with every thing and every one
alike. This was probably the point of Antonius’ taunts on the
sub'ect.

7⁸} quanta: = in quanta. Cp. qaam = ad qnam, xi. 24.

11. animo : ablativo of respect, ‘⁶ in spirit.⁷'

12. manens: the participle (= si maneret) does duty as protasis to
conficeret, as in the next clause dimissa (= si dimissu exsec) to liberaret.

14. lumina: for the metaphor, cf. our ⁴⁴ shining lig-ht&

15. praetorios : “ ex-praetors‚'' ‘⁴ men of praetoriun rank.’⁷

16. florem t we have the same metaphor. Caesar says that the loss
on Pompeius’ side at Pharsalus was l5‚000.

17. quamvis: to bc joined closely with iniqua, “tei-ins of peace
however unfair.” Thus used, quamvis does not. of course, affect the
mood of its clause (teneremus being hypothetical subjunctive, tho
apodosis to m· viverent).

22. ut alia. omittam: ‘⁴' not to mention other results.’' Thc sub—
junctive is in roality final.

24. at: see ii. 10, note.

26. sermones ς “ conversati0n‚’' “talk ⁷' (sermo = ser-imo, from sero,
‘⁴ join ” = ‘⁴ a colloquy ‘').

27. quidem: “assurcdlyst

29. ego quid ille ε the full expression would be eyo ridebam quid ille
sentiret el spectaret, et oonlra illev etc.

30. incolumitati . . . dignitati: contrastcd :is “secui-ity⁷' and
Η11οι1οιιι’.”

32. habebat . . . quid sequeretur: “ knew what were his aims.''
The use of habere in this sense (like ἔχειν in Greek) is fairly common.

36. de Pharsalia fuga: literally “straight from his Phar-salian
rout‚” i.e. the rout at Pharsalus. So de itinere, ‘⁴ straight from. fresh
from, the inurch,” often in Caesar.

37. Paphum τ Paphos in Cyprus, famous of old as a principal
seat of the worship of Aphrodite (Venus). Pompeius touched there in
his flight towards Egypt.

41. sectorem: sectio (xxvi. 12) denoted a public sale of confiscated
property, sector, one who purchases such property, a ‘⁴ broker.'’ The
dcrivation is dubious, either from secare, “ tocut up,” or from sequi
·’ to pursue.'' Cicero here adopts the latter view. playing upon the
