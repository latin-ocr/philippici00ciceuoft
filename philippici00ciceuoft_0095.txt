assonance between sector and insectari (sectari, frequentative of sequi).
lt does not seem possible to keep up the pun in English.

eh. XVI. 6. animis : ablative of respect.

10. hereditates: in Rome the bequeathing of legacies was a
favourite way of marking one's appreciation of one's friends. This
statement of Antonius was an insinuation that Cicero had few
admirers.

ll. esset: the past tense indicates that the wish is not capable of
realisation.

12. viverent: potentini subjunctive. The suppressed protasis is
easily supplied from the preceding¹ clause (eg. si rernm esset crimen).
qui: “how ’ἓ ”

13. sestertium ducentiens: ‘⁶ (20οχ 100,000=>20‚000‚000sesterces,‘'
or about 5180‚000. The figures are not incredible, in view of Cicero's
position at the very top of his profession-the most important profes-
sion in Rome. where a numeral adverb is joined to sestertium
(=sestert2‘0rum), the words centena milia are almost invariably omitted,
and sestertium is treated as a. declinable singular substantive,
instead of an archaic plural genitive. Amplius is parenthetic,

“twenty millions ον more.'' acceptum . . . rettuli: ‘⁴ entered to my
credit by legacies.'’ See the note on v. 39.

15. genere: sc. of money-making.

18. casinas: (genitive, casinatis) “ of Casinum‚” which was one of
the small hill-towns of southern Latium, situated on the Via Latina
near to the frontiers of Campania, about eighty miles from Rome.

19. albus aterne fuerit: utrum is to be supplied before albus. As
the sequence is primary, what was an historic tense (imperfect indica-
tive) in the direct question (utrmn albus erat, aterne ?) is represented
in indirect form by a primary tense (perfect subjunctive), accord-
ing to rule. The expression is a proverbial one to signify absolute
1⁰norance.

D⁵20. Q. Fufii: sc. filium, from the previous clause.

⁶21 . factitarat: “ had represented '' as his heir.

24. dicas: jussive subjunctive in semi-dependence on the potential
velim. L. Turselius: another of those who were alleged to have made
Antonius their legatee. The insinuation which Cicero makes is,
obviously, that Antonius got the property by foul means.

28. alienissimorum: “in no way related to you.'’ Cp. alienus,
vi. 15.

31. hereditatem . . . adisses: “refused to take possession of the
estate bequeathed to you by your father,‘’ because the liabilities attach-
ing to it outweighed its value, οι· in plainer language, because it was
bankrupt. There was no law to compel a Roman to accept (adire) a be·
quest or inheritance, and naturally if the debts upon it swallowed up
the assets, he would decline it. But when the estate concerned was
