unwilling, 01 Ourio’s unscrupulousness: it is quite as
likely that Caesar's persona] influence and ansar's money
were the responsible factore.

S 5. The promptitude with which Caesar acted upon the
appeal 01 the tribunes and forthwith invaded Italy, took
the Senate and Pompeius by surprise. without attempt-
ing to defend Rome they retired upon Campania, and
thence across the Adriatic to Epirus, there waiting idly
while their opponent secured his hold upon the western
portion 01 the empire. M. Aemilius Lepidus was named
city prefect3 the tribune Antonius was granted the rank
and powers 01 a pro-praetor; and to these two Officers was
left the care 01 Italy and R ome. Caesar in person sailed
at once for Massili ’1 ζ Mar welles) a city 01 immense strength,
which O. Domitius Ahenobarbus was holding 101 Pompeius.
He sta3 ed 11010 only long enough to determine the plan 01
siege which his lesatecs C Trebonius was left to cany 0111,

capitulation 01 Massilia immediately followed, and Caesar
returned to Rome in the autumn. He was named Dic-

consul 101· 1110 new year <48 Β.0.), and spent the next few
weeks in various measures 101· the restoration 01 public
credit. By Cicero' s account Antonius had made only bad
use 01 his authority, spending most 01 1110 time in a scan-
dalous tour 01 1110 towns 01 Middle Italy (ᾗ 58).

In the spring 01 48 Β. c. Caesar crossed into Epirus and
laid siege to Pompeius 111 Dynhachium (Dm azzo), Antonius
doing brilliant work as officer in command 01 the line 01
communications‚ with his base at Brundisium. Pompeius
cleverly made good his escape from Dyrrhachium, but
Caesar, by an equally able movement, caught up with him
in Thessaly, forced him (August 9th) to give battle near
Pharsalus, and annihilated his army.
