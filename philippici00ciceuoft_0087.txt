ed the governorship of Illyricum and Gallia Cisalpina by the Lex
Vatinia, passed in 59 B.C. (Gallia Transalpina being added later in the
year by the Senate). This appointment was for five years, expiring
March l, 54 B.C. 3 but in 55 B.C. hc persuaded Pompeius and Crassus, then
consuls, to “ extend (murmure) the appointment for five years more.'⁷

11. ne pateretur . . . haberetur: ⁴⁶ Not to permit the law to be
passed which provided that account should be taken of him (Cacsar)
though absent.” Rationem habere, ‘⁶ to take <a thing) into account‚’' is a
common phrase. The historical point involved is important. Caesar,
in his consulship 59B.C.‚ had made bitter enemies among the Sena-
torial party, and notably in Cato. The recognised way of ruining a
pohtical opponent in Rome was to ixupeach him: for if condemned
his ruin was complete; and if it did not seem likely that a conviction
could be obtained, the prosecutor had only to serve his enemy with
notice of trial, and thereby debui· him from holding office until the
case was tried. If, therefore, his enemies could impeach Caesar, he
was a ruined man. Now so long as a man held public office, either as
a magistrate of Rome or as a> provincial governor, he could not be
impeached. Therefore Caesar’s enemies were bound to postpone their
attack upon him until he had ceased to be governor of the Gauls and
Illyricum (not later than March 1, 49 B.c.). As soon as that happened,
he would be privatus once more, and therefore at their mercy. Caesar
knew what to expect. His only legal means of escaping impeachment
was so to arrange matters that the moment he ceased to be governor of
Gaul, he should enter upon another magistr-acy, viz. the consulship of
48 B.C. ‚ and that his command in Gaul should be continued up to the
very last day of 49B.c. The latter he effer-ted by secui-ing that no
successor should be nominated who could take his place before J anuary
1, 48 B.C: the former was more difficult to remise, because the law
required that any one who desired to canvass for the consulship must
do so in person, i.e. must come to Rome to (lo so; while another law
ruled that any governor of a province who left the limits of his pro-
vince before the termination of his term of command, was guilty of
treason, and moi-cover became privatus. Cacsar got out of the dilemma
by inducing Pompeius to secure the passing of a pricileqiunz, a special
exactment exempting Caesar from the necessity of coming to Rome to
canvass for the consulship of 48 B.c.
