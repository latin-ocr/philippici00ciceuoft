130 INDEX or PROPER NAMES.

stari-ing plebs, had incurred the hostility of the patricians and was
accused of aiming at the crown. Ahala summoned him to appear
before the Dictator, and on his refusing, stabbed him on the spot.
It was traditional in Rome to extol the conduct of the murderer, and
to rank him with those who expelled the Tarquins (ᾁᾲ 25, 87).
Servilia, the mother of the Liberator, M. Brutus, was descended from
this Servilius, Ahala.

Silanus, -i‚ m.: D. Junius Silanus, when colleague of Murena as
consul-designate for 62 B.c., supported Cicero in his policy against
the Catilinarians (ξ 12).

Sulla, -ae, 1n. : L. Cornelius Sulla, who first came to the front as
a commander in the Social War of 90-88 B.C., led the party of the
(jptimates, or Senate, against the democratic party under Marius
and Cinna. The two factions came to blows as soon as the Social
XVar was ended, as to who should be appointed to prosecute the war
against Mithradates, king of Pontus. Sulla won the day, and sailed
for the East ; but his rix-als immediately recovered their power, and
exerc-ised complete despotism ,in Rome for some five years, until
Sulla's return in the autumn ot* 83 B.C. His return led to another
Civil XVar, in which the party of the democracy was completely
worsted, and Sulla in his turn became master of Rome. He signalised
his triumph by an armed entry into the city and a wholesale pro-
scription of his opponents (ξ 108). He remained practical sovereign
of Rome under the style of perpetual dictator, from 82 to 79 B.c.‚
when he voluntarily resigned, dying a natural death in 78 B.C. As
his violence was exercised on the side of the sonate, Cicero says very
little about it. Some of the laws he caused to be passed as dictator
were of real and permanent value.

served with distinction as leqatus to Caesar in Gaul, conducted the

he had in that very year soundcd Antonius, who was then at Narbo
(ᾧ 34), to discover the latter-'s real attitude towards Caesar. After
the murder he fied like the rest of the conspirators, and presently
made his way to the province of Asia, of which he had been led by
Caesar to expect the governorship. Here he was seized and put to
death by Dolabella in 43 B.C.
