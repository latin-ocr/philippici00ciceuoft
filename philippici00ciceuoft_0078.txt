consul should have been most eareful to aeknowledge the right of
in'erer‘ssio (for which sce on ii. 5).

32. stipatus armatis: Antonius had furnished himself with a sort
of bodyguard, which he used for purposes of intimidation, aq. at the
(omitia. Yet it was unlawful for auyone to bear arms within the
precinets of the Oity.

35. M. Crasso: the triumvir of 59 ΒΛ). Cicero implies that, though
Crassus was his bitter political enemy, he was at least a gentleman,
and to be treated as such.

36. uno gladiatore: meus is occasionall)⁷ thus used to emphasize a
superlative. Cp. umcm pulcherrimam, xxxiv. 2. Glrrdiator is used
metaphorically (“ a ruffian '') from the fact that gladiators were a by-
word for evil living and reeklessness.

ARGUMENT.—§§ 7-10, Antonius Ims published certain pria-ale
lellers ofmine. It is a yross breaeh qsyood manners, and it is fiolis& loo;
fur {fI were to dewy that I wrote rhem, lle could not prore that Ῑ did. He
has mid his leaclzers hands-mneos sor teacltfinffl him sully Ι But I admit I
wrote the letters, Apparently the only μνία-(τηεν Ite can siml in them is
that they are so polite in their tone. l miqht produce lenm-s os his—-
{euers in which lle assessor mys consent to mensures for which, (ts we were
μίτρη to understand, he lead Caesar's aallzorily. Ic is permissible to ask,
then, why lte should scelc any perani-§sion ofmc‘ne.

ch. IV. 2. quas . . . diceret: z quas . . . dizit. The meaning is
exaetly the same as if we had quas sihi misissem, where misissem would
be the subjunctive of reported description, iinplying that the clause
was part ot¹ Autonius' own assa—tion, ‘⁴ a letter which he alh-{sed I had
sc11t.’' As the verb of savying (dicere) is here added, there is no
syntaetical reason why the subjunctive should be used, but the idiom
is so common in similar cases as to be almost the rule, and it must be
explained as due to attraction to the moed of reported description.
Professor Mayor cites, as an instance of similar carelessness in English,
the sentence ‘¹ He went awav because he said it was late ’'
(= “because it was late, or so l1e⁹said '’).

3. vitae communis: ‘¹ the life of niun auiongst mcn,'' “social life. '’
So Communi sens-2( plane earet, “He is completely without the social
instinct. ⁷' Gummwzis incaus simply “ what is shared by all,” :uid has
nothing to (lo with “ common ’' iu the sense of “ordinary ⁷⁷ or
‘⁴ vulgar.'’ Tho genitivos humanitatis and vitae are objective.

4. qui . . . nosset: “ if he but knows,'’ an instance of the so-called
restrictive force of qni with the subjunctive, in reality a variety of the
consecutive usage.

6. in medium protulit z “ made public‚'’ medium beingsubstantival.

7. quid est aliud tollere: “what else is this but to do away
with . . . ,’' translatiug as if quam or uisi were inserted (as it some-
times is) after aliud.

ll. sit hoc inhumanitatis ε “ let us regard this as (a proof of) your
laek of breeding.'' 'rhe genitive is predicative.
