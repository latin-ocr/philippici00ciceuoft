[See Index of Proper Names for Catilina and Clodius]

ch. 1. 1. patres conscripti: “ Senators.” As applied to the
senators patres originally meant the same as patricii, for originally
none but patricians sat in the Senate, although plebeians were admitted
from a very early period. In the phrase patres conscripti, the second
member is either an adjective qualifying patres, or a substantive coor-
dinated with patres by asyndeton, i.e. the phrase stands for patres et
conscripti. In the former case, patres conscripti most probably meant
those patricians who were ,“ enrolled” (conscripti) by the king to act
as his senate, in conti-ast with the remainder of the patricians not so
enrolled. In the latter case (i.e. if the phrase stands for patres et
conscripti), patres denoted originally only such senators as were patri-
cinus, and conscripti included all other (i.e. plebeian) members of the
House.

2. his annis viginti: “for (within) the last twenty years.” As
the Romans reckoned inclusively, it was just twenty years since
Catilina had plotted to overthrow the government and to murder Cicero
(so the latter believed).

3. indixerit: subjunctive, the relative clause being consecutive or
generic (qui = ut is).

4. nominari: but two names are given below, namely, Catilina and
Clodius. Cicero now includes Antonius in the list. poenarum: the
genitive (partitive) depends on plus.

6. †optarem: potential subjunctive, i.e. subjunctive forming the
apodosis to a hypothetical sentence of which the protasis is suppressed,
“more than Ι could have wished (had Ι been allowed to choose).’⁷
Some editions read optaram, “more than I actually had desired.''
quorum . . . eorum: the relative clause precedes its grammatic-al
antecedent, an arrangement which English idiom does not admit.

7. quorum . . . imitere ε subjunctive, because the clause is depend-
ent on a main phrase in the accusative and infinitive. Exitus
(⁴⁶ their several ends '’) is a good instance of the distributive use of the
plural. hoc: the fact that they were hostile to Cicero personally.
For he had himself begun the quarrel with Catilina, by accusing him
of revolutionary desig-ns, and he had made an enemy of Clodius by
appearing as a witness against him when on his trial for profanation of
the m steries.

9. ziei publicae causa: “on patriotic grounds.''

11. ultro : in its normal sense of “beyond (ultra) what is reason-
able,’' i.e. “ without provocation.”
