Res ycstue as opposed to vila means public as opposed to private life.

ch. 11. l. contra rem suam . . . venisse: “went counter to his
interests.'’ Cicero, it seems, had uppenrod in a law-suit on behalf of
some ‘· friend und relative ⁷² (preses-utor), whose antagonist (defendant)
wus a protege of Antonius ; and the lust-named, in order to save the
defendant from the consequent-es of the conviction which xnonueed
him, indm-ed a tribune to put a stop to all further proceedings by his
veto. Nothing is known with certainty as to the facts of the case.
