civic robe, the bays to morit bow ’') formed the opening line of the
vainglorious poem which Cicero, having failed to induce better poete
to undertake it, himself composed in honour of his own achievements
as consul, The poem provoked nothing but ridicule, and Antonius
had quoted it derisively. Arma is opposed to toya as the military to
the civilian power (see the note on toqato, vi. 9) ; and the real
sense is that Cicero , the civilian consul, had proved himself a much
greater person (by suppressing the Catilinarians) thau any of the
generals of the time. cesserunt: the word cedant above was used in
the sense of “take second place.” Cesserunt here (and cessit in the
next clause) bears the different and less offensive sense of “make way
for.” Cicero, endeavouring to shuffle out of the charge of conceit
to which the wording of his poem very justly laid him open, declares
that Antonius does not understand his poetry (omnino uon nosse) and
has mistaken his meaning.

eh. IX. 3. cum . . . insecutus es: the clause is purely tempor-al,
and therefore the verb is iu the indicative. Transegsisses is hypo-
thetical subjunctive, its clause being· the apodosis of the conditional

attempt of Antonius to kill Clodius in the course of a riot, 53 B.C.‚
when Antonius was a candidate for the quaestorship. See xx. 7.
