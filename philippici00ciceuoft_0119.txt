011. xxxva] norme. 109

12. 1.. Bellieni: a senator whose house was burned in the riots at-
tending the funeral.

14. ex maxima parte: we say “ in tho main (part).” quos: the
antecedent is impetus. The mob made an abortive attempt to burn and.
loot other houses.

16. reliquis diebus : ablativa of time within which.

17. ne ι the final clause depends on consulta, ‘⁴ resolutions to prevent
the posting of any record, etc.’' Tabula is the plate of bronze upon
which official acts were engramd, the tabula being then posted
{fiqereff in some recognised place, eff. the Capitoline Temple (see
ine 28 .

18. immunitatis : ‘¹ exemption.’' See the note on immania, xvii. 14.
Caius is of course from qais indefinite.

20. dictaturae nomen: “the style of Dictator,” by which Caesar
had been best known. The dictatura, “office of the Dictator,''
was originally a revival in effect of the monarchy, the two
consuls being superseded for the time by ono supreme commander
at home and abroad. This course was generally taken to
meet some grave peril, aq. a. foreign war or a domestic sedition;
and its purpose was to get rid of that divided command which
was an inherent weakness of the consulship. In process of
time the dictatura lapsed, partly because it was too powerful an office
to be entrusted to an individual. The last dictator of the normal kind
was Fabius Maximus, 216 B.c., in the Hannibalic lVar. The later
“dictatorships” of Sulla (82-79 Rc.) and Caesar had nothing in
common with the older dictatura, but were merely inst-annes of the
abuse of an honourable title to conceal absolute but unconstitutional
power. Antonius proposed and carried a resolution that the very name
of Dictator und Dictatura should be prohibited for ever.

23. †eius omen omne : “ everything suggestive (or ominous) of it.’'
The MSS. have eins omen nomen, which is amended either as in the
text, or to eius omne nomen. As nomen occurs two lines above, if the
choice is between omen and nomen the former is the better reading.

26. fefellit: sc. Antonius.

27. sui dissimilis esse: cp. xxxv. 18.

29. singulis z ‘⁶ to individuals.'' So sinqillatim, line 30.

30. provinciis: an exaggeration. The only province which ob-
tained the civitas by Antonius' means was Sicily.

33. perdidistis: because the gift of civitas carried with it that of
immunitas (line 18).

34. nundinis ε see on xiv. 24.
