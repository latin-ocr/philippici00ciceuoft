fact that at the Lupercalia (February 15th) Antonius had
publicly offered a regal diadem to Caesar. They assassi-
nated Caesar in the Curia on the Ides (15th) of March.
Antonius was not privy to the crime, indeed they feared
his interference. Once before, says Cicero, he had been
sounded by O. Trebonius at Narbo (ᾖ 34), but without
success. He had indeed everything to gain if Caesar lived,
everything to lose if Caesar died.

The senators fied in terror on hearing of the murder.
Antonius too fied (ξ 88) for a time. But he quickly re—
covered his wits and tried to get possession of all Caesar's
papers and treasure. The conspirator& finding to their
chagrin that their deed did not at once meet with universal
approval‚ took refuge in the Capitol, aud opened negocia-
tions with the leaders of. the senatorial party. The Senate met
on March 17th, and passed resolutions that the murderers
should be amnestied‚ and that Caesar’s aeta—all that he had
done and intended to (lo—should be regarded as law.
The two resolutions were logically incompatible: if the
murderers were blameworthy they deserved no amnesty3
if blameless, then their victiin’s aeta could not be legal.
But the senators only sought to temporise. As a guar-antee
of his good saith Antonius gave his infant son by Fulvia
as a hostage to the Liber-ators in the Capitol (ξ 90).

There followed Caesar-’s obsequies. By command of the
senate the dead man’s will was publicly read. It named
as heir-in-ehief his great-nephew O. Octavius (better
known as Augustus); Antonius was amongst the heredes
secunda· (ξ 71) ; and ansar’s park on the north bank of the
Tiber was bequeathed to the State, to the people a legacy
of 300 sesterces (about 33 per man). The knowledge of
‘these facts caused a furious outburst of feeling, of which
Antonius took instant advantage. The mob burned
Caesar-'s body in the open Forum upon an extemporized
pyre. At least one senator's house (ξ 91) was burnt in
the riot, and the liberators were compelled to fiee for their
lives. By way of condoning the effects of his inflammator-y
rhetoric, Antonius, as consul, moved one or two resolutions

of a conciliatory tone: one was that the style of Dictator
should be henceforth abolished (ξ 91); another declared
