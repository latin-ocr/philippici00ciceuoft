30. quae excitent: final. The object indmnnientmn (to which te
must not be supplied) is purposcly indefinite, ⁴· the man who can go
to sleep over a question so momentous.’' Causae is of course dative.

oh. XIII. 2. punctum: accusative of duration of time.

4. nisi . . . sint: subjunctive as a dependent clause in Oratio
Obliqua, it being a part of the admission introduced by confiteor.

7. siquidem: either (1) “since,’' which is the usual meaning in
Cicero, or (2) ‘⁴ if indeed.’'

9. quid dicis: ‘⁴ what (lo you call th0111?’' With si parricidas in
the next clause. sc. dieis.

11. referente te: ‘⁴ ou your motion.'’ For this technical sense of
rcferre, see on vi. 16. legibus est solutus τ “ exempted from the law.'’
As praetor urbanus (44 B.C.) M. Brutus could not legally be absent
from Rome for more than ten days. On the motion of Antonius,
however, a privileqiecm had been passed, releasing him from these
limitations of time.

12. ludi Apollinares ε the public games in honour of Apollo occupied
the whole of the second week in J uly, and were given under the super-
intendence of the praetor urbanus for the year. M. Brutus, however,
did not preside in person,being at the time absent from Rome (see
last note).

13. incredibili . . . honore: ablative of attendant circum-
stances, “with unheard-of tributes to Brutus‚'' the genitive being
objective. As a matter of fact, Brutus, who had hoped to make
political capita-l out of his presidency of the games and thereby obtain
some pronounced expression of popular feeling in his favour, was
entirely disappointed.

14. provinciae: Crete and Cyrene. Brutus received the former
instead of Macedonia, and Cassius the latter instead of Syria, both on
the proposal of Antonius. quaestores additi : alluding apparently to
the fact that Antonius, on removing Brutus and Cassius to inferior
provinces, gave to each, by way of empty compliment, an unusual
number of attendant quaestores and leqata. Every provincial governor
was attended by a quaestor representing the Treasury, but usually by
one onl .

15. lggatorum: “adjutants'’ 01· ‘⁴ aides-de-camp.’' As with the
quaestores, so with the leqati: according as they were inore or fewer
the dignity of the governor was enhanced or diminished.

16. homicidas: sc. dieis. liberatores : sc. dicas. This was the name
by which the assassins of Caesar delighted to style themselves, as having
*⁶ freed '⁷ Rome from his tyranny.

19. quae diiunctius dicuntur: “ what is stated pretty much in the
form of a dileinma.” Diimwcus (= logically opposed), like its Greek
equivalent dilemma, is a logical term applied to such alternatives as
eff. ‘⁴ A is either B or not-B.” So here : ·‘ Brutus and Cassius are either
murderers or not-murderers.'' But inasmuch as the strict form ot¹
the alternative (⁶⁶ not-murderers ⁷⁵) is replaced by a less logical term
(⁴⁴ liberators '’), Cicero correctly uses the comparative diiunctius in lieu
