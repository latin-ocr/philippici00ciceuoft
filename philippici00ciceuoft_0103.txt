eh. XXIV. 1. essedo: a two-wheeled carriage. The name is
Celtic, and the original of it was the Gaulish or British “war-
‹·hariot.'' lictores laureati: Antonius could only be entitled to an
escort of lictores as propraetor, not as tribune. But his appointmem
to the rank of propraetor was itself irregular, and in any case he had
no right to have his lictors laureati, that is, carryingsnsces decked with
bays in honour of victor-ies gained by the magistrate whom they
escorted.

2. aperta lectica: lectica is a litter, or “chair‚'' carried by
slaves. It was not considered correct for a magistrate to be seen
abroad aecompanied by his women-folk: still less for the women to
ride about in chuirs; and least of all, in uneurtained chnirs. The
ablative is instrumental. mima: ep. viii. 27. Her mimicum nomen,
‘⁴ stage-nan1e,'' was Cytheris, but off the stage she preferred to be.
addressed as Vol uinnizi.

3. municipales homines: “ burgesses.” See note on line 9,
below.

5. raeda: a four-wheeled “ wagon’' or ‘⁶ van.'' Like the essedum,
it was of non-Italian, probably Celtic, origin.

9. municipia. praefecturas. colonias: a classification of the bulk
of the communities os Italy as they stood before the end of the Social
War (88 B.C.)‚ i.e. throughout the major portion of the Republic's
history. lt had been the polioy of Rome to secure her hold over
Italy by the extension of the “ municipe] charter‚’⁷ πλε. by establishing
gradually but surely a universal form of government copied from her
own :—a government of annually elected magistrates assisted by a
senate. The extension was effeeted in two ways; (1) by founding
“colonies‚'' ale. creating new towns having the municipal eonstitu-
tion, the colonists being citizens sent out from Rome; (2) by absorbing
Italian comniunities already existing, and granting to them a larger or
smaller part of the franchise on condition of their adopting the muni-
eipal constitution. Very rarely she gave the full cecitas Romana to
such municipes, From time to time trouble arose with one or other of
these communities, which resulted in Roine's sending for the time an
annual “ administwator (praefectus ino-i dicundo) to lepresent hei
interests. This amounted to a temporary interference with the

“''charter of suth towns, but they did not therefore cease to be in
effect mzmwipia 01· coloniae, is the case might be. Nevertheless to
prevent dangerous coalitions, arising from community of inteiests and
of disabilities, each charter cont nned some special features (not how-
ever sufficient to effect the general form of the constitution) which
sufficed to separate every mumcipium from the rest: while at the same
time the municipal fraiuhise as a whole fen far shoit of full civitas·
Romana. This last was enjoyed by sel) few save the most important
of the coloniae. It was to obtain the fun civitas that the Italians rose
in rebellion 111 the Social WVar (91-88B.c.)‚ the result of which was
that Rome gave way, the charters were renewed in one consistent
shape, and thenceforward all the Itali were also eires (with a very few
voluntary exceptions). As before, however, certain towns required
