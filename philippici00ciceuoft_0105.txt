allusion in this difficult passage seems to be as follows. The State,
having to furnish the horses which ran in the circus-shows, levied u
tax for this purpose on the givers of the shows. It then let out
the job for a lump suin to contractors (hence equi veceiqales) who
provided the horses. of course at a profit to themselves. Senators
alone were eligible to undertake the eontract, but in this case Antonius
seems to huve handed over the affair (illegally) to Sergius. hano:
the house of Pompeius, in the Carinae, the fashionable district on the
slope of the Esquiline Hill, overlooking the east end of the Forum.
Antonius after the death of its owner acquir-ed it by confiscation,
which explains male tuetur, “keeps with disticulty,'’ “finds it diffieult
to keep’' (for Pompeius' heir-ut-law, Sextus, wished to recover it).
Previously Antonius had lived in another confiscated house, the
property of the ex-consul M. Pupius Piso.

28. levitatis: levitas is the opposite of qraeitas, and qravitas is,
in Latin, that peculial· quality which makes a man a gentleman,
“soundness,” “reliability‚'' “responsible conduct.'’ To the Roman

which marks a gentleman, was actually a worse offence than mere
improbitas, “ purposed villainy.'' istis faucibus: ablative of attendant
circumstances, as are also the ablatives that follow. lateribus:
