INDEX OF I'ROPER NAMES.

 

A.

Antonius, -i, m.: four persons of this name are mentioned in the
speech. (1) M. Antonius, grandfather of No. 4. He was consul
(ᾗ 70) iu 99 B.C.‚ and was put to death amongst many others of the
senatorian party by the democratic revolutionarics Marius and Cinna
in 87 B.C. He was an orator of considerable ability, and is more than
once spoken of by Cicero in terms of praise (ᾧ 42). He received a
commission to act against the pirates in 102 B.C., but effected little or
nothing. (2) M. Antonius Creticus, son of N ο. 1 and father of No. 4.
He obtained his coqnomen of Creticus in mockery of his ill-success iu
dealing with the Cretan pirates, as propraetor, 74 B.C. fiis wife was
a J ulia, a relative of C. Julius Caesar. According to Cicero his estate
was so heavily encumbered on his death, that his son (No. 4) publicly
refused to accept the inheritance (ξ 42). (3) c. Antonius Hybrida,
brother of No. 2 and uncle ot No. 4, and father of a daughter Antonia
who became the second wife of No. 4, was eolleague of Cicero in the eon—

70 B.C. he was degraded from the Senate, but soon regained his position,
probably in the next censorship, 67 B.C. Cicero alleges that he was
actually implicated in the Catilinarian conspiracy, and that his loyalty
was only secured by Cicero's surrendering to him the prospective
government of the wealthy province of Macedonia ; but it was
C. Antonius who ultimately defeated Catilina at the battle of Pistoria.
His governorship was so extortionate that he was banished, and Cicero
remarks that his nephew (No. 4), though he recalled from exile a
number of bad characters, did not extend this charity to his uncle
(ὁ 70). He was probably recalled by Caesar, for he was in the Senate

House on January lst, 44 B.C. (ξ 98). His nephew subsequently put
him forward as a candidate for the censorship; but had not the

impudence to prosecute his intention at the polls (ξ 99). (4) Marcus
Antonius, the Triumvir. His career up to the date of the delivery of
this speech is sketched in the Introduction. After that date '‘Septem-
ber 19th‚ 44 B.C.) he found his position in Rome so uncomfortable,
partly owing to the vigorons attacks of Cicero, partly because of the
growing popularity of C. Octavianus (Augustus), that he presently
