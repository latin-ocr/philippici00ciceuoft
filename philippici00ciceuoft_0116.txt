at least as soon as the result of its votiug was announeed (renuntiatur),
and before any other centul-ies had proceeded to the poll. This
would have been illegal, but not more so thau his ultimate action,
and it would have aroused far less resentment. But tacet, he still
remained dumb. renuntiatur: ‘⁶ the result of its voting was
announeed.'’ Each century had a single vote only, and this it deter-
mined by a poll of its own members. The result was then reported
(venantium) to tho comitia at large, and the successim votes of each
