120 CICERO, PHILIPPIO 11. [cn. XLV.

8. re . . . beneficio . . . fama: ablatives of 1·espect; ‘¹ glorious inthe
doing‚’' ‘⁴ pleasing in the bencfit it confers,” etc. The doctrine
1hat tyrannicide is in all cases laudable was borrowed by Rome from
(frreece. In Greece its truth was in no wise considered to depend upon the
character of the dospot or the circumstances which made him despot.
On neither of these grounds is it possible to defend the murder αἱ
Cacsar.

11. occasionis tarditas: ‘¹ the tardy appearance of an opportunity.’'
The assassins will make, not awuit, their opportunity.

14. mecum: sc. aye, ‘⁶ trent me.”

15. videris: future perfect.

19. obtulerim : potentini subjunctive, ‘⁶ I would (if need were)
willingly offer.’' repraesentari: “be realised at ont-c.'’ ‘⁴ be made a
present 1·eulity,’⁷ the metaphor being from paying money down.

22. annos: the accusative, not the ablative, is the regular con-
struction with abhinc, which in classic-ul prose always refers to the past,
und precedes the noun it belongs to. It was, in effect, nineteen years
ns we rcckon it, twenty according to the Romans’ inclusive manner of
counting, since the occasion alluded to, viz. ‘the Fourth (and last)
Spcech against Catilina, December 5th, 63 B.C.

24. seni: sc. immaturam esse.

25. quas adeptus sum: referring to his honores.

28. hoo: ablativo. Cicero did not see his wish realised, for when
he died lloine was under the yoke of the Triumvirs, Antonius, Lepi-
dus, and Octavianus—a yoke far heavier and less merciful than that of
Caesar.
