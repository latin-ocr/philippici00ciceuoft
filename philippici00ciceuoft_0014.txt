4 INTRODUCTION.

Transalpine Gaul to his command, hoping that he might
come to a bad end in the attempt to oust the German
invader Ariovistus from Gaul. Caesar annihilated the
Germane in a single battle, and then proceeded to conquer
the whole of Gaul in detail. The task was a big one: it
was so far from completed in 56 nc. that he took steps to
have his appointment prolonged for another term of five
years.

In the meantime the other Triumvirs, Pompeius and
Crassus, had quarrelled with one another and with every-
one else, and P. Clodius Pulcher had taken advantage of
the fact to make himself the exponent of mob-rule. The
Senate found a champion of the same stamp, but of
opposite political opinions, in T. Annius Milo3 and these
two “gladiators'’ fought almost daily in the streets.
Government was at a standsti113 the Triumvirs were
threatened with eclipse; Cicero (whose recall froin exile
had been effected in 57 Bo, mainly by Pompeius in order
to spite Clodius) fondly believed that he was strong enough
to rally the Senate to the recovery of its ancient supremacy,
and to win over Pompeius to its side. But at the Con-
l'erence of Luca in 56 Bo, where Caesar met his fellow
Triumvirs again, fresh arrangements were made which
secured for the three a further lease of power. Pompeius
and Crassus were assured of the consulate of 55 Bc, and
as consuls they secui-ed the passing of a bil] (Lex Licinia-
Pompec'a) by which the original term of Caesar's command,
as authorized by the Lac Vatinia of 59 Be, was extended
for a urther five years. The two consuls also obtained
five—year commands, Pompeius in Spain, Crassus in Syria
against the Parthians. Pompeius never left Italy:
Crassus did, and was slain with most of his army at
Carrhae beyond the Euphrates, in 53 Bo

§a Meantime Pompeius' natural inclination towards
the senatorial party was steadily reasserting itself. This
tendency was very materially quickened when (in 54 Rc.)
he lost his wife Julia, Caesar’s daughter. He felt that he
owed his position since Luca to Caesar‚—felt‚ that is, that
Caesar was the better man, and therefore felt jealous. Hev
hoped to use the Senate to gratify his jealousy. The
