13. praetextati: “dressed in our robes of state.” For the prae-
texta, see on xviii. 3. It was worn by all officials when acting in an
official capacity or on great occasions, and so virtually = “holiday-
dress. '

14. supplicationes: see on vi. 6. Antonius further passed a resolu-
tion that to all supplicationes there should be added an extra day in
honour of Caesar. As Cacsar (says Cicero) was only a lnor‘cal after ull,
to introduce his name in such a connection was to profane (contaminari)
the sacred character of a snpplt'oalio. Fui-ther, as this (September leth)
was the fifth day which Antonius had proposed ‘co add to the ludi
Romani in Circo, thore should (had the proposal been carried out) have
been displayed a pulvinar with a simulacrum of dicas Iulius. As
Antonius, theflamen diri Ialii, had failed to see that tho fifth day was
duly added and honoured, Cicero concludes that it must be because he
hcsitated to profano the pulvinaria in this fashion. 'l'hen why did he
not hcsitate to profano the supplicationes ,2 It is another instance of
Antonius' inconsistency.

proverbial for what we call “ the nakeel t1·utl1‚'’ but thoro is a further
play upon peetus in its literal senso. 'l'he allusion is of course to
Antonius’ haranguing tho poople in his dress os a Lupercus. See ξ 86.
